# CAM

Material for talk to Classical Association of Massachusetts, October, 2016, on bringing text analysis into the Latin curriculum.


Initial contents:

- `srctexts/caesar_bg.txt` is the raw text of the Latin Library's text of Caesar, *Bellum Gallicum*
- `scripts/parseBg.groovy` is a groovy script that converts that file to 2-column format
